    "In this assignment, you'll analyze a collection of data sets from the [San Francisco Open Data Portal](http://data.sfgov.org/) and [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/). The data sets have been stored in the SQLite database `sf_data.sqlite`, which you can [download here](http://anson.ucdavis.edu/~nulle/sf_data.sqlite). The database contains the following tables:\n",

    "Table                   | Description\n",
    "----------------------- | -----------\n",
    "`crime`                 | Crime reports dating back to 2010.\n",
    "`mobile_food_locations` | List of all locations where mobile food vendors sell.\n",
    "`mobile_food_permits`   | List of all mobile food vendor permits. More details [here](https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/rqzj-sfat/files/8g2f5RV4PEk0_b24iJEtgEet9gnh_eA27GlqoOjjK4k?download=true&filename=DPW_DataDictionary_Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit.pdf).\n",
    "`mobile_food_schedule`  | Schedules for mobile food vendors.\n",
    "`noise`                 | Noise complaints dating back to August 2015.\n",
    "`parking`               | List of all parking lots.\n",
    "`parks`                 | List of all parks.\n",
    "`schools`               | List of all schools.\n",
    "`zillow`                | Zillow rent and housing statistics dating back to 1996. More details [here](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `mobile_food_` tables are explicitly connected through the `locationid` and `permit` columns. The other tables are not connected, but you may be able to connect them using dates, latitude/longitude, or postal codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shapefiles for US postal codes are available [here](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_zcta.html). These may be useful for converting latitude/longitude to postal codes.\n",
