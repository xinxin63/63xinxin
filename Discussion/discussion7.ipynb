Harvest will start in La Pampa and\\n  Buenos Aires in mid-April.\\n      The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3\\n  to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.\\n      The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln\\n  tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,\\n  and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2\\n  mln tonne crop.\\n      The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,\\n  remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5\\n  pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for\\n  1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of\\n  7.1 mln.\\n      The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln\\n  to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln\\n  sown in 1985/86.\\n      The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some\\n  areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some\\n  experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas\\n  making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on\\n  this were not available.\\n      Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which\\n  will be sown between May and August or September, has so far\\n  not been as intense as in previous years.\\n  \\n\\n\",\n",

The whole game is bringing out new products and improving\\n  the old ones.\"\\n      Analysts say the chemical industry\\'s biggest customers,\\n  automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of\\n  paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.\\n      U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about\\n  90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike\\n  product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,\\n  managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand\\n  for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up\\n  by as much as 300 pct, he said.\\n      Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in\\n  Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned\\n  last year and predicted it would have the best year in its\\n  history.\\n      In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel\\n  and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.\\n  dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. \"I believe the entire\\n  chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,\"\\n  Oreffice said.\\n      GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical\\n  industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.\\n  Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion\\n  dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.\\n      The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical\\n  industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and\\n  planning, said Pace\\'s John Dosher.\\n      Dosher said last year\\'s fall in oil prices made feedstocks\\n  dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar\\n  was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost\\n  U.S. chemical exports.\\n      Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has\\n  been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical\\n  manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers\\n  in the early 1980s.\\n      Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers\\n  have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program\\n  to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate\\n  unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of\\n  friendly and hostile takeover attempts.\\n      GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire\\n  Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs\\n  for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics\\n  and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> \\n  has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer\\n  businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.\\n      But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be\\n  headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on\\n  the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as\\n  ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that\\n  are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.\\n      \"Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the\\n  past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity\\n  chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had\\n  deteriorated,\" Dosher said. \"But I think they will eventually\\n  kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche\\n  market.\" Some top chemical executives share the concern.\\n      \"The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting\\n  carried away and repeating past mistakes,\" GAF\\'s Heyman\\n  cautioned. \"The shift from commodity chemicals may be\\n  ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.\"\\n      Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the\\n  Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700\\n  mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.\\n      Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout\\n  of Dupont\\'s Conoco Inc\\'s chemical business, has spent 1.1\\n  billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants\\n  along the Texas Gulf Coast.\\n      The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that\\n  are the building blocks of specialty products.\\n      \"This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a\\n  glamorous, high-margin business,\" Cain said, adding that demand\\n  is expected to grow by about three pct annually.\\n      Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said\\n  chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for\\n  plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood\\n  and steel products.

Foreign\\n  exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and\\n  trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.\\n      Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and\\n  commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net\\n  investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.\\n      Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first\\n  quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell\\n  to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.\\n      If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means\\n  that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are\\n  actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9\\n  mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume\\n  payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.\\n      After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for\\n  credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared\\n  with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.\\n      It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after\\n  charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49\\n  mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.\\n      Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were\\n  583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year\\n  earlier.

To\\n  stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by\\n  excess inventories since 1985 will take some time.\"\\n      He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough\\n  in trying to sell in the Japanese market.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

The\\n  company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in\\n  restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.\\n      Heineken\\'s Spanish activities should start yielding profit\\n  next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had\\n  already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.\\n      Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the\\n  European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer\\n  into the closed West German market -- Europe\\'s biggest beer\\n  market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"We\\n  have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important\\n  point,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken\\n  had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.\\n      \"The question is not if we want to penetrate the German\\n  market, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding that\\n  while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a\\n  taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very\\n  regionalized.\\n       Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for\\n  African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most\\n  important beer growth markets in the long term.\\n       He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with\\n  majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was\\n  hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.\\n      Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters\\n  per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions\\n  and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total\\n  1986 sales.\\n      On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price\\n  of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists\\n  have been looking at other possibilities.\\n      To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on\\n  the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which\\n  had sold successfully, Coebergh said.\\n      Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw\\n  materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were\\n  popular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could not\\n  possibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said.\\n      Chairman Heineken said the company\\'s seven year efforts to\\n  penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a\\n  contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.\\n      But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken\\'s\\n  market potential.

But since then, Wall Street has been\\n  speculating that American Brands would find another candidate\\n  to help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco.\\n      \"This is just typical,\" said George Thompson of\\n  Prudential-Bache securities. \"There\\'s going to be more to come\\n  here.

       " u'BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION\\n  Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler\\n  called on central banks of major industrialised nations to\\n  cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.\\n      In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released\\n  here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was\\n  protectionism and control on capital movements.\\n      \"Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market\\n  transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have\\n  them,\" he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would\\n  have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop\\n  to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.\\n      Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets\\n  had parted company with transactions in goods, services and\\n  investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that\\n  determined market trends.\\n      Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to\\n  grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates\\n  would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.\\n      \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required are\\n  different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --\\n  those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of\\n  mounting economic activity,\" Koehler said.\\n      The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.\\n  Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation\\n  going by talking the dollar down posed problems.\\n      The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep\\n  rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost\\n  of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports\\n  to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to\\n  make itself felt compared with the price effect.\\n      \"Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going\\n  further than would be necessary to adjust the current account\\n  over the medium term,\" Koehler said.\\n      A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur\\n  only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.\\n  In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should\\n  rise faster than GNP.\\n      \"In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,\" Koehler said.\\n      If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be\\n  prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by\\n  an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..\\n      But only if there was an appropriate interest rate\\n  differential would Europe and Japan look for financial\\n  investment in the U.S.\\n      When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank\\n  had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its\\n  measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.\\n      Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates\\n  by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading\\n  interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market\\n  and its substantial impact on exchange rates.\\n      It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of\\n  price stability, economic growth and full employment but also\\n  to tackle international problems like the exchange rate\\n  problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.\\n      A strategy had to be designed that helped \"the safeguarding\\n  of non-inflationary economic growth in an international\\n  monetary system largely free of disruptions,\" Koehler said.\\n      Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was\\n  necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed\\n  to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over\\n  the next few years and intervention points should not be set,\\n  because they were only testing points for the market, he said.\\n      In order to keep the international monetary system free of\\n  disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but\\n  also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

The yen sank below 145 at one point\\n  despite intervention by the Bank of Japan.\\n      Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan\\'s Finance Minister, said the\\n  movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading\\n  ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.\\n      \"I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past\\n  several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the\\n  discussions in Paris,\" Miyazawa said yesterday.\\n      The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was\\n  announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of\\n  Miyazawa\\'s departure for Washington, to attend yesterday\\'s\\n  meetings of leading industrial nations.\\n      In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action\\n  \"extraordinary and urgent\", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris\\n  Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges\\n  broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.\\n      The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West\\n  Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore\\n  repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to\\n  foster exchange rate stability.\\n      The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central\\n  bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the\\n  dollar\\'s fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of\\n  intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent\\n  years. Monetary sources also said they understood that\\n  Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely\\n  successful in the light of the Japanese announcement.\\n      They also said there was a growing feeling among the\\n  finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over\\n  medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term\\n  differences in past meetings.\\n      West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like\\n  the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of\\n  yesterday\\'s statement to have won acceptance from other\\n  countries that its exchange rate is acceptable.\\n      Bonn\\'s finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that\\n  major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance\\n  between West Germany and Japan\\'s trade surpluses and America\\'s\\n  trade deficit have already taken place.\\n      No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut\\n  the budget deficit even though it is implied in the\\n  reafffirmation of Paris.\\n      European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are\\n  essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that\\n  reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.\\n      A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this\\n  week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further\\n  sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would \"clearly pose\\n  substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could\\n  undermine confidence in future financial stability,\" he said.\\n      Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the\\n  politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.\\n      Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany\\n  welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own\\n  currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.\\n      Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak\\n  dollar blunts Tokyo\\'s export drive to the United States, the\\n  Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.\\n      The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making\\n  their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian\\n  Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.\\n      Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit\\n  to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.\\n      The United States and France, backed by the International\\n  Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or \"norms\" for a\\n  limited number of economic objectives such as growth,\\n  inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current\\n  account balances.\\n      Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in\\n  consultations between the countries on whether corrective\\n  action should be required.\\n      But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives\\n  has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it\\n  implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.\\n      The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully\\n  sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit\\n  currency fluctuations just before the February meeting.\\n      The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges\\n  of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the\\n  relatively free currency markets of recent years.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

They had hoped that new vitality in the\\n  industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil\\n  prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope\\n  with growing mounds of debt.\\n      IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed\\n  the industrial country economies would move up to an annual\\n  growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.\\n      Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some\\n  time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into\\n  an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.\\n      Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier\\n  states for markets for their products as well as financial\\n  assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations\\' \\n  economies poses fundamental worries.\\n      Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have\\n  only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,\\n  including the key one of exports.\\n      The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,\\n  has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it\\n  too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only\\n  2.3 pct, according to the IMF.\\n      For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the\\n  United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to\\n  ignite their economies but with little apparent success.\\n      The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and\\n  the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade\\n  deficit.\\n      Reagan administration officials have been saying that the\\n  impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much\\n  slower than expected.\\n      The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that \"it has\\n  to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to\\n  work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years\\n  to get a resonably complete effect.\"\\n      The report added, however, \"the adjustments may take even\\n  more time on this occasion.\"\\n  REUTER^M\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

The government's perceived need to control inflation by\\n  keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.\\n      High real interest rates were attracting an influx of\\n  speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the\\n  government's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.\\n      Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,\\n  liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17\\n  pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a\\n  target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.\\n      To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money\\n  rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from\\n  11.8 at end-1986.\\n      Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to\\n  hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,\\n  with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new\\n  wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.\\n      These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish\\n  workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.\\n      He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the\\n  state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five\\n  pct wage ceiling.\\n      Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in\\n  Spain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first\\n  two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct\\n  increase over the corresponding period last year.\\n      However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the\\n  peseta to correct the imbalance.\\n  \\n\\n\",\n",

Although the company said it would meet\\n  commitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.\\n      And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes\\n  per year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks\\n  and contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the\\n  U.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and\\n  a regular supplier to the world market.\\n      Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,\\n  have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.\\n      On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up\\n  quite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported\\n  in the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the\\n  first two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying\\n  order was filled by merchants in March.\\n      Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices\\n  this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and\\n  establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months\\n  delivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in\\n  Gothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often\\n  a target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.\\n      On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp\\n  and Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,\\n  and this is believed to be in strong hands.\\n      Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest\\n  level since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses\\n  which are not popular with merchants putting together\\n  shipments.\\n      But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since\\n  the start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to\\n  secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies\\n  affected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on\\n  the transport of used batteries.\\n      Labour negotiations in North America will play an important\\n  part in determining the direction of prices, with contracts\\n  expiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,\\n  Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.\\n      Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract\\n  expiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of\\n  strikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.\\n      Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting\\n  speculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current\\n  firmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium\\n  to 20 from four.

He only recommends one stock,\\n  however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to\\n  make them more efficient.\\n      Despite his bearishness, Merrill\\'s Bradford continues to\\n  recommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.\\n      Armco\\'s steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance\\n  sheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business\\n  has been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford\\n  noted. \"It\\'s not a high-quality investment situation yet but\\n  they\\'ve come a long way,\" he said.\\n      \"We think the stock will do moderately better than the\\n  market,\" he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,\\n  could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.\\n      Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,\\n  before special gains from recouped investment tax credits,\\n  against losses last year.\\n      Armco\\'s 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he\\n  said.\\n      Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. \"We had a buy\\n  on it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have\\n  it,\" he said.\\n      The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a\\n  share in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and\\n  from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. \"But a lot\\n  depends on oil prices,\" he added. About 60 pct of USX\\'s sales\\n  come from oil and natural gas.\\n      Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of\\n  Salomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. \"The company\\'s done a lot\\n  (of restructuring), more than the market\\'s given them credit\\n  for,\" she said.\\n      She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher.

Wednesday borrowings were\\n  1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.\\n      \"One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it\\n  probably isn\\'t,\" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.\\n      Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy\\n  modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the\\n  two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging\\n  around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.\\n      However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest\\n  two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand\\n  often pushes up borrrowings.\\n      \"Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it\\n  looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions\\n  late in the statement period and didn\\'t quite make it,\" said\\n  Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.\\n      A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that\\n  the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or\\n  more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.\\n      Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in\\n  its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer\\n  reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.\\n      The Fed took no market reserve management action last\\n  Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added\\n  temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of\\n  customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves\\n  directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.\\n      Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the\\n  two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on\\n  Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday\\'s\\n  overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.\\n      \"It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at\\n  this time,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.\\n      Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi\\n  said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest\\n  rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak\\n  economies in the United States and abroad and add to the\\n  financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.\\n      \"Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest\\n  statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar\\n  tumbled,\" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.\\n      He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new\\n  statement period began today on disappointment yesterday\\'s\\n  Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed\\n  to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.\\n      In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in\\n  Wednesday\\'s G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that\\n  the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade\\n  imbalance between the United States and Japan.\\n      The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for\\n  steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average\\n  Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where\\n  the rate has been since early November.\\n      \"I\\'m not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter\\n  policy to help the dollar, as some suspect,\" said Sullivan of\\n  Dean Witter.\\n      If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just\\n  nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from\\n  six to 6.10 pct previously.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

Interest rates fell\\n  sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.\\n      But that confidence is now cracking as the financial\\n  markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker\\'s\\n  often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.\\n      \"Volcker\\'s been saying for a long time that a dollar\\n  freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he\\'s got it,\" said\\n  David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.\\n      The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in\\n  40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington\\n  failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a\\n  credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short\\n  of further depreciation of the dollar.\\n      Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid\\n  worries that the dollar\\'s slide will rekindle inflation, scare\\n  away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.\\n      The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12\\n  dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike\\n  in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down\\n  by 33 points to 2339.\\n      Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the\\n  markets\\' instability frightening. He believes economic\\n  fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that \"once\\n  you start the ball rolling it\\'s difficult to stop.\"\\n      \"There\\'s a stark possibility that you could get a\\n  destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates\\n  and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.\"\\n      Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics\\n  in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the\\n  controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and\\n  264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.\\n      \"We\\'re still more or less on track for a hard landing... But\\n  the agony may be fairly drawn out,\" Marris told Reuters.\\n      Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this\\n  year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it\\n  would take very little to touch off what he calls the second\\n  phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the\\n  dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.\\n      The stock market\\'s reaction today and its sharp drop on\\n  March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.\\n      The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with\\n  historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are\\n  not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its\\n  decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.\\n      Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar\\'s latest\\n  weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks\\n  suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling\\n  below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as\\n  part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.\\n      Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of\\n  confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced\\n  plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic\\n  imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.\\n      Many economists believe that long-run stability will not\\n  return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is\\n  addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the\\n  massive budget deficit.\\n      But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of\\n  central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no\\n  choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.\\n      \"The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a\\n  substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding\\n  cut abroad, at least by Japan,\" said Lanston\\'s Jones.\\n      Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest\\n  rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for\\n  American farmers, Latin American governments and others.\\n      But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and\\n  Co, scoffed at the notion. \"It\\'s ridiculous to think the Federal\\n  Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak\\n  against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar\\n  weakness,\" he said.\\n      Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being\\n  made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.\\n      \"We\\'re going to have one of the biggest reductions in the\\n  budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody\\n  cares,\" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69\\n  will have been greater.\\n      He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and\\n  thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.\\n      But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that\\n  a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. \"Put on\\n  your helmets,\" Giordano said.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

That distaste stems in part from fears of recession.\\n      Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told\\n  television interviewers he did not think a policy of driving\\n  the dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit.\\n      \"It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would\\n  adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would\\n  drive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not\\n  (into) recession, into slower growth,\" he said.\\n      Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize the\\n  dollar, Balladur said: \"When a currency is maintained\\n  artificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it is\\n  not healthy.\"\\n      And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to\\n  recession, he said.\\n      Acknowledging the dollar\\'s latest slide was now a fact of\\n  life, Balladur said, \"there may be adjustments of course in one\\n  or other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system.\"\\n      But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he\\n  might rein in credit if the dollar\\'s slide deepens.\\n      U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it\\n  understood by markets the seven\\'s commitments were genuine.\\n      \"The United States and the six major industrial countries\\n  are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these\\n  agreements,\" Baker told the meetings.\\n      Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which\\n  wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further\\n  decline in the dollar.

But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable\\n  currencies applied to today\\'s exchange rates and not those at\\n  the time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.\\n      The Paris accord said, \"currencies (are) within ranges\\n  broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, given\\n  the policy commitments summarized in this statement.\"\\n      Now they accept the dollar\\'s lower level, especially\\n  against the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent\\n  with the agreement. \"The ministers and governors reaffirmed the\\n  view that around current levels their currencies are within\\n  ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals,\" last week\\'s\\n  statement read.\\n      Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were\\n  focusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S.\\n  Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan\\n  rather than prospective policy changes.

Merrill\\n  Lynch officials did not return phone calls.\\n      Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman\\n  sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics\\n  business.

       " u'U.S. BANKS LIKELY TO LIFT PRIME RATES AGAIN SOON\\n  Major U.S. banks may lift prime\\n  lending rates again within days due to recent increases in\\n  their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is\\n  nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.\\n      In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most\\n  banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to\\n  7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own\\n  cost of money. That spread has narrowed again.\\n      \"A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,\"\\n  said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.\\n      Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is\\n  justified because the spread between banks\\' cost of funds and\\n  the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a\\n  percentage point.\\n      He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage\\n  points since last October until it fell below one point and\\n  triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.\\n      \"We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon\\n  as this week,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.\\n      \"We\\'ve got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the\\n  near future,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.\\n      \"Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding\\n  costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,\"\\n  said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.\\n      However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime\\n  because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan\\n  demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain\\n  recent upward pressure on money market interest rates.\\n      Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift\\n  short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He\\n  said \"if there is widespread belief money market rates will\\n  stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.\"\\n      Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a\\n  dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar\\n  fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders\\n  said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.\\n      In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to\\n  stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.\\n  interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.\\n      Based particularly on the Fed\\'s reserve management actions\\n  on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said \"it has become\\n  clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure\\n  in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.\"\\n      Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest\\n  rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation\\n  that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.\\n      That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the\\n  market than most economists had expected.\\n      On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small\\n  amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements\\n  with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another\\n  high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct\\n  today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr\\n  round of customer repurchase agreements.\\n      \"The Fed\\'s actions on Friday and today show that it is\\n  offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,\"\\n  said Jones of Lanston.\\n      \"The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the\\n  need to defend the dollar,\" Jones said. He believes it is\\n  merely shading policy toward restraint now, \"but to have a\\n  major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy\\n  overtly at some point.\"\\n      Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by\\n  becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within\\n  four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.\\n      Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might\\n  well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to\\n  further aid the dollar.\\n      Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on\\n  30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate\\n  may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year\\'s end.\\n      \"The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening\\n  policy to defend the dollar,\" said Leslie of Discount Corp. He\\n  said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.\\n  Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures\\n  abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.  \\n  \\n\\n',\n",
