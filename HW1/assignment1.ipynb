    "\n",
    "The Doomsday algorithm, devised by mathematician J. H. Conway, computes the day of the week any given date fell on. The algorithm is designed to be simple enough to memorize and use for mental calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example.__ With the algorithm, we can compute that July 4, 1776 (the day the United States declared independence from Great Britain) was a Thursday.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is based on the fact that for any year, several dates always fall on the same day of the week, called the <em style=\"color:#F00\">doomsday</em> for the year. These dates include 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, and 12/12.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example.__ The doomsday for 2016 is Monday, so in 2016 the dates above all fell on Mondays. The doomsday for 2017 is Tuesday, so in 2017 the dates above will all fall on Tuesdays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The doomsday algorithm has three major steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the anchor day for the target century.\n",
    "2. Compute the doomsday for the target year based on the anchor day.\n",
    "3. Determine the day of week for the target date by counting the number of days to the nearest doomsday.\n",

    "\n",
    "__Example.__ Suppose the target year is 1954, so the century is $c = 19$. Plugging this into the formula gives\n",
    "$$a = \\bigl( 5 (19 \\bmod 4) + 2 \\bigr) \\bmod 7 = \\bigl( 5(3) + 2 \\bigr) \\bmod 7 = 3.$$\n",
